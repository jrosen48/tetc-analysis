In Individualizing Reading and Writing Instruction in the Elementary and Middle School Grades, elementary-grades pre-service teachers build knowledge and skill about digital, multimodal composing and how to engage elementary- and middle-grades students in this work. In this course, pre-service teachers also create and share a digital, multimodal literary analysis to further build knowledge and skill in this area. 

In professional development with in-service teachers, we support teachers to build knowledge and skill with using device agnostic apps designed to support elementary-grades students to collaborate using technology in the context of reading, writing, drawing in the context of project-based learning. ","""3. I support the development of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of teacher candidates as related to teaching with technology in their content area."" - This competency is important to my work as an ELA/literacy teacher educator because of the digital literacies needed for K-12 students to become effective communicators in today's society. This competency is also important to my work because of current expectations for teachers to meaningfully and effectively teach with technology in their content area and their need for knowledge and skill to evaluate, select, and teach with technology tools that will most enhance their own instruction and the learning of their students.

""4. I use online tools to enhance teaching and learning."" - This competency is important to my work as a teacher educator because my own effective use of online tools to enhance teaching and learning can serve as a model for pre- and in-service teachers. In addition, the effective use of online tools to enhance teaching and learning allows for expanded avenues for communication, collaboration, and feedback when working with pre- and in-service teachers. ","""11. I engage in leadership and advocacy for using technology."" - I selected this competency because it is important to bring a critical lens to the use digital tools for teaching and learning, and to support pre- and in-service teachers to do the same. While it is important to my work as a teacher educator to advocate for using technology tools that have the potential to support teachers to engage in transformative teaching and learning, I would not advocate for using technology simply for the sake of using technology. ","One thing that is important in my work related to educational technology that is not reflected in the TETCs is supporting teachers to critically evaluate technology tools for teaching and learning based on their potential for enhancing classroom instruction. Pre- and in-service teachers should be supported to then use those evaluations to make informed selections of technology tools and to design instruction that effectively incorporates tools that enhance teaching and learning in K-12 classrooms. ","I develop my own technology competencies through research partnerships between the Schools of Education and Information at my university, focused on developing digital tools for learning designed for use by students in the elementary grades. 

I also develop my technology competencies by attending technology-focused sessions at conferences, consulting with teacher educators within my own and at other universities, and by reading related research and practitioner journals. ","A number of the faculty members within my department have particular interests in/commitments to developing pre-service teachers' competencies with technology in the context of teaching and learning.

The third graders responded to the Flipgrid videos by posting a video response that indicated their favorite product from the challenge, and each third grader provided at least one piece of evidence to support their reasoning. ","The one competency that I consider as being the post important to my work as a teacher educator is supporting the development of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes as related to teaching with technology in their content area. I believe that before teacher candidates are able to integrate technology into their own classrooms effectively, it is imperative that they first understand how to support their own learning with technology. At the beginning of my technology education courses, my students participate in activities and projects that encourage them to use technology in ways that support their own learning and understanding of topics they are passionate about/interested in.

So, a key aspect of what I do is teach students how to evaluate their own technology use in a way that ensures (1) that they are having their students interact with the tech and/or create learning artifacts through it (e.g., constructionism) and (2) that their tech use intentionally improves their pedagogy in a way that is amplifying or transforming of their previous practice.","I attend conferences, try new techs in my class and research, and constantly experiment with and troubleshoot my own devices (e.g., running a LAMP server).",My institution generally provides me with the resources and freedom necessary to try new things and to take ownership of my own professional learning.,Major asset I experience / have experienced.,Major asset I experience / have experienced.,Asset I experience / have experienced.,Neutral / neither a barrier nor an asset.,Neutral / neither a barrier nor an asset.,Neutral / neither a barrier nor an asset.,Major asset I experience / have experienced.,Major asset I experience / have experienced.,Major asset I experience / have experienced.

 - I have designed a module which incorporates professional blogging to develop and assess student teachers' professional knowledge and understanding.
- I use screen capture and digital video to supplement face-to-face approaches e.g. to model process or introduce concepts which can then be discussed face-to-face.
- I use social media (Twitter, professional and academic blogs) in my teaching encouraging students to connect with the wider professional networks in education.
","I find competency 4 important because I find carefully selected use of technologies can enable ways of bridging the gap between theory and practice.

1) This year I transformed my pre-service teacher ed class into a personalized learning approach to model how to structure a course to provide voice and choice to students and meet their needs. This included a menu of  items as well as an option to propose their own assignment.

2) All of my teacher candidates need to prepare a written lesson that integrates technology and then deliver at least a portion of the lesson to their classmates. This exposes the other teachers to different pedagogical approaches and tools but also gives the teacher candidate an experience managing ""students"" that are all using technology at different ability levels. Their ""students"" then have to give them three pieces of constructive feedback on their lesson.

3) I use Seesaw as my classroom LMS. Seesaw is not used very much at the higher ed level but it is one of the most used tools at the elementary level. So I model the use of Seesaw (using the activities function, creating lessons that encourage interaction between students online, and giving feedback to students) so that they are able to effectively use this tool in the future.


","1. Engaging in ongoing PD and networking
You need to be up to date on the latest tools, resources, etc. if you are going to teach educational technology courses. Everything changes quick and you need to keep up.

2. Supporting the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes...
Toolset, skillset, and mindset is the framework in which I approach training my educators. Pre-service teachers have to a growth mindset when it comes to education in general but particularly educational technology.","Engaging in leadership and advocacy for using technology. I do that as the course coordinator but some of my instructors don't need to do that to be effective with teacher candidates. ","I give my teacher candidates a full lay of the land and that includes technology that they do not necessarily use instructionally but will be expected to use administratively. We touch on it briefly but letting them know they will have some sort of student portal where attendance, lunch, and behavioral issues happen. Explaining that their district will likely have an email system in which they will collaborate with peers on documents such as IEPs and use to reserve spaces such as computer labs. I also give a lay of the land in how decisions or processes work within districts related to technology.","I keep one foot in the door at a K-12 school district and one foot in academia. It allows me to speak from experience on what my tech coaches, admin, and teachers actually experience. I go to K-12 edtech conferences (not just academic research conferences) and learn.","Being that I work half in K-12 schools and half in academia, I feel I don't get bogged down in theory but can provide a class that is more practical and tangible.

I am increasingly aware of the tensions students feel around their use of social media as a professional, or their use of particular tech tools because their out-of-school experiences may not have prepared them to think critically about professional uses for these tools.

(More on this below.)","What I don't see explicitly reflected is the need to foster a critical eye on digital technology usage. The ideas presented in Postman's ""Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change"" might help develop such a critical, careful, nuanced approach. Postman argues that we not look at any technology as a neutral tool or an automatically positive development. Any new technology comes with its own powerful idea and myth-producing. Technology is also culturally disruptive, involves a set of trade-offs, and leads to ecological results which often foster inequities. I urge us to ask: What social impact might a new technology create, both intended and unintended? What is gained and lost through the use of it? How sustainable is this technology? How cheap, easy, and accessible is the technology for us and our students to use and fix?","Using it on a daily basis and looking for new ways to use and improve it in the classroom.

This includes persevering when snags are encountered with using technology as well as finding out more about what a technology can offer students both with academic/curricular learning and social-emotional learning.","Sorry, they're all important....","So often, we teacher educators focus primarily on content ""delivery"" and strategies that develop academic growth in kids. Important, certainly. However, I remind my teacher candidates that we don't teach subject matter, we teach children. I wish teacher education explored more opportunities to develop and support social-emotional learning using technology so we could see how 21st century skills (the 4Cs - creativity, communication, critical thinking, collaboration) are skills that also build community and relationships not just content understanding and expertise. 

OK, off the soapbox....thanks for listening. ;-)","I read research in the field and spend a great deal of time exploring and testing out new tools, strategies, and ideas.
